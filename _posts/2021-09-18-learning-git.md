## Intro

I have been always felt tormented while using Git when working with teams or even alone. This below comic from xkcd aptly summarizes my experience with Git.

To finally get comfortable, and efficiently use Git, I went through this lecture(link) from **Missing semester** course. Trying to summarize and demnstrate my learnings. Recommend this [video](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/) and lecture notes for detailed walkthrough.

## Data model
1. Terminology:
    - **blob** - a file (which is a bunch of bytes) is called a blob 
    - **tree** - a directory is called a tree, it maps names to blobs or treees
        ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/learning_git/blob_tree.png "credit: ./missing-semester")
    - **commits** - snapshots are called commits.
2. DAG (directed acyclic graph):
    - Each snapshot in git refers to a set of 'parents' (snapshots that preceded it).
        ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/learning_git/dac_snapshots.png "credit: xkcd")
    - A snapshot might descend from multiple parents (due to merging)

    - The arrow points to the parent of each commit
    - Commits are immutable

## Command line

### Basics
- ```git help <command>```: get help for a git command
- ```git init```: creates a new git repo, with data stored in the .git directory
- ```git status```: tells you whatâ€™s going on
- ```git add <filename>```: adds files to staging area
- ```git commit```: creates a new commit
    Write [good commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)!
    Even more reasons to write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)!
- ```git log```: shows a flattened log of history
- ```git log --all --graph --decorate```: visualizes history as a DAG
- ```git diff <filename>```: show changes you made relative to the staging area
- ```git diff <revision> <filename>```: shows differences in a file between snapshots
- ```git checkout <revision>```: updates HEAD and current branch
