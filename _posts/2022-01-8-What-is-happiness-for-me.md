I want to reach such a place in my life where I can work on what I want and love. Also this work should not be for money [period]. If I achieve this, I would just stop and start living my life slow.

Things I might want to do when not working for money:
- Learn music
- Learn leather work
- Inspirational orator
- Create stuff with hands - rather than computer
- Travel
